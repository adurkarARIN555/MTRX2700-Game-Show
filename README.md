## Catapult Toss:
**Requirement Specification:** 
- A game power meter will run back and forth until the user stops it
- Indication by the power meter will determine how far a projectile is tossed by the catapult
- Whoever makes the projecile travel the least distance is eliminated
**System Design:**
- In order to simulate the power meter, the STM board LEDs will cycle back and forth at about 5ms per change.
- When the user button is pressed, the LED pattern stops and the particular number of LEDs that are ON determines the shooting strength
- Shooting strength determines how much the launching springs are pulled by the servo and in turn the projectile will travel a greater distance for more LEDs ON and a smaller distance for less LEDs ON
